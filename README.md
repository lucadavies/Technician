# Luca Davies

Hi! My name is Luca (sometimes I live on the second floor), and I am theatre and events technician with just about 10 years of experience under various guises. I began during school, first as a followspot operator, before trying my hand at various roles, but honing in primarily on lighting.

At school, we ran a mostly fixed rig of fresnels and profiles with colour in-fill provided by LED battens and controlled by an ETC Ion. Between 2012 and 2017, we staged whole-school productions of seven musicals and three plays, with a number of smaller events and shows throughtout. Technical operation of multiple years of A-level and GCSE Drama pieces were also entrusted to me for their rehearsals and final recorded performances. A small number of events also required the set-up and operation of a small PA system for music and speeches.

After school I earned a place at Lancaster University to study Computer Science. Alongside my study, I took my interest in the technical side of theatre and events further by joining Lancaster University Theatre Group (LUTG) and gaining employment with the Students' Union as a member of their Events Crew. As a mebmer of LUTG, I staged ten shows as a member of the production's core team and aiding 14 further shows directly as get-in/get-out crew and technical assitance. These productions ranged from full-scale 'traditional' musicals down to experimental small-cast shows utilising unconventional venues and new technology. With the Students' Union, work was generally more events focussed, often involving marquee and gazebo setup, ranging from corporate events to small festival setups.
