# Luca Davies

Hi! My name is Luca (sometimes I live on the second floor), and I am theatre and events technician with just about 10 years of experience under various guises. I began during school, first as a followspot operator, before trying my hand at various roles, but honing in primarily on lighting.

At school, we ran a mostly fixed rig of fresnels and profiles with colour in-fill provided by LED battens and controlled by an ETC Ion. Between 2012 and 2017, we staged whole-school productions of seven musicals and three plays, with a number of smaller events and shows throughtout. Technical operation of multiple years of A-level and GCSE Drama pieces were also entrusted to me for their rehearsals and final recorded performances. A small number of events also required the set-up and operation of a small PA system for music and speeches.

After school I earned a place at Lancaster University to study Computer Science. Alongside my study, I took my interest in the technical side of theatre and events further by joining Lancaster University Theatre Group (LUTG) and gaining employment with the Students' Union as a member of their Events Crew. As a mebmer of LUTG, I staged ten shows as a member of the production's core team and aiding 14 further shows directly as get-in/get-out crew and technical assitance. These productions ranged from full-scale 'traditional' musicals down to experimental small-cast shows utilising unconventional venues and new technology. With the Students' Union, work was generally more events focussed, often involving marquee and gazebo setup, ranging from corporate events to small festival setups.

At University, more LUTG shows used a small vairety of generic and intelligent fresnels and profiles, occasionally hiring LED parcans and/or moving lights for larger shows. Control was most often ETC Nomad or Element. Meanwhile, the Events Crew used the same LED parcans/moving lights, controlled by ETC Ion and Avolites Quartz or Tiger Touch, with sound operated on Roland or Allen & Heath digital mixers.

After completing my degree, I first entered industry as a software engineer, continuing voluntary theatre work on the side with the Pengiun Club who assist a number of  amateur dramatics groups in Cambridge, and at the Cambridge Arts Theatre. After a year of this, and ending up rather unhappy, I quit software, and jumped into working backstage fulltime. I jumped straight into working the full Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2022 as venue technician for Underbelly, and following that I went freelance to take work where and when I can. Since doing so I have worked with SLX for their Trains projects for this year, Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, and Truro School.
