I am an enthusiastic and dedicated technician with nearly ten years' of experience in theatre and events. I am comfortable working alone, as part of a larger team, or in leadership or teaching roles where appropriate. I am highly committed to good organisation and professionalism throughout my work, with a focus on preserving the integrity of the show or project. I am also keen to learn and develop my skillset at all turns, with a particular penchant for learning lighting control systems.
